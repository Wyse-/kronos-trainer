# Kronos Trainer
The idea is to provide a user friendly way to practice OSRS bosses, that *actually* feels like the real game.  
This is based on the [Kronos](https://rune-server.org/threads/kronos-osrs-semi-custom-server-deob-client-multi-world-support-184.696766/) private server code, which is mostly untouched, except for a few small fixes.  
The server runs locally on your own machine.

# Notes
- Kronos is based on the 184 version of the game, which is roughly from early 2019: anything released after that time is not be available.
- The client runs on an older version of [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite/runelite), available plugins are limited.
- Remember this is running on private server code, expect bugs and things not working perfectly.
